EduPay Africa
Phase 1 MVP – System Description & Technical Requirements
1. Project Overview
EduPay Africa is a digital education finance platform designed to simplify and centralize school and university fee management across Africa, starting in Kenya.
Phase 1 focuses on delivering a credible, functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that introduces EduPay Africa, captures institutional interest, and lays a solid technical foundation for future fee payment and reconciliation features.
This phase prioritizes:
Public visibility and trust
Lead capture (demo requests)
Secure authentication groundwork
Scalable backend architecture

2. Phase 1 Objectives
The objectives of Phase 1 are to:
Provide a professional public-facing website for EduPay Africa
Clearly communicate the problem EduPay Africa solves and its vision
Enable institutions to request product demonstrations online
Automatically acknowledge demo requests via email
Establish a secure authentication mechanism for future system access
Prepare the backend for expansion into fee payment and reconciliation features
Phase 1 does not aim to fully implement fee payments or financial transactions.

3. Scope of Phase 1
3.1 Public Website
The MVP will include a responsive website with the following pages:
Home
Overview of EduPay Africa
Problems faced by parents, students, and institutions
Current capabilities of the MVP
Future vision of the platform
About Us
Mission and purpose of EduPay Africa
Target beneficiaries
Contact Us
Contact information
Inquiry form (non-authenticated)
News & Careers
Updates about the platform
Career or partnership information (static or admin-managed)
3.2 Navigation
The main navigation bar will include:
Home
About Us
Contact Us
News & Careers
Login (authentication handled via Firebase)
Book a Demo (lead capture form)

4. Demo Booking Feature
Institutions interested in EduPay Africa will be able to request a demo by submitting a form.
4.1 Data Collected
The demo request form will collect:
Full name
Email address
Phone number
Institution name
Institution type (e.g. University, College, School)
Approximate number of students
Optional message
4.2 Backend Handling
All demo requests will be securely stored in the Django backend database
Requests will be viewable via the Django Admin dashboard
Each submission will trigger an automated confirmation email
4.3 Automated Email Response
Upon successful submission, the requester will receive an automated email stating:
“Welcome to EduPay Africa.
Thank you for requesting a demo.
Our team will get back to you shortly.”
This confirms receipt and establishes trust.

5. Authentication Strategy
Phase 1 will integrate Firebase Authentication for identity management.
Firebase will handle:
User identity (email or phone-based login)
Secure token issuance
Django will handle:
Token verification
User role management (future phases)
Business logic and data access control
This separation ensures scalability and security while enabling future mobile and web clients.

6. Technology Stack (Phase 1)
6.1 Backend
Django (Python web framework)
Django REST Framework (for API readiness)
PostgreSQL (primary database)
6.2 Authentication
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Admin SDK (backend verification)
6.3 Frontend
Django templates
Bootstrap for responsive UI
6.4 Email
SMTP-based email delivery (Gmail or transactional email service)
6.5 Deployment
Gunicorn (application server)
WhiteNoise (static file serving)
Cloud hosting platform (e.g. Render, Railway, Heroku)

7. Phase 1 Dependencies
The following Python dependencies are required for Phase 1:
Django
Django REST Framework
Firebase Admin SDK
Requests
Python Dotenv
Gunicorn
WhiteNoise
PostgreSQL database driver
These dependencies support the website, authentication, email handling, and deployment needs of the MVP.

8. Security & Data Protection Considerations
Sensitive credentials will be stored in environment variables
Firebase tokens will be verified server-side
No financial transactions are handled in Phase 1
Demo request data is restricted to authorized administrators only

9. Limitations of Phase 1
Phase 1 explicitly excludes:
Fee payments
M-Pesa or bank integrations
Scholarship disbursement
Multi-institution financial reconciliation
Student or parent dashboards
These features are planned for subsequent phases.

10. Success Criteria
Phase 1 will be considered successful if:
The website is publicly accessible and responsive
Demo requests are successfully captured and stored
Automated emails are sent reliably
Firebase authentication is functional
The system can be demonstrated live to stakeholders

11. Future Expansion (Phase 2 Preview)
Phase 2 will build upon this foundation to introduce:
University fee structures
Student profiles
Fee balance tracking
M-Pesa STK Push integration
Payment reconciliation
Parent and bursar dashboards
