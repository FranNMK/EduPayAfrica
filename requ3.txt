## 8. Phase Readiness Outcome

✅ Bursars can track balances
✅ System is **payment-ready but payment-free**

---

## 9. Why This Order Is Correct (Decision Rationale)

**Hidden assumption to challenge:**

> “We need payments early to show value”

That’s wrong.

**First principles:**

* Payments without clean fee data = chaos
* Reconciliation requires structure first
* Institutions care more about **control** than payments

This phase:

* Reduces financial risk
* Speeds later payment integration
* Builds institutional trust
