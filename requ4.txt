## Parent & Student Dashboard – Requirements Document (Pre-Payments)

---

## 1. Document Purpose

This document defines the requirements for the **Parent and Student Dashboard** in EduPay Africa.

The dashboard is designed to provide **visibility, transparency, and trust** around student fee information, while preparing the system for future digital payment integration.

This phase focuses on **viewing and verification**, not payments.

---

## 2. Core Principle (Very Important)

> **Parents and students do NOT manually search for schools.**
> Institutions determine visibility by **linking parent contact details (phone/email) to student records**.

This ensures:

* Privacy
* Data accuracy
* No impersonation
* Institution-controlled access

---

## 3. User Roles Covered

* Parent / Guardian
* Student

Both roles use similar dashboards with role-based restrictions.

---

## 4. Parent Dashboard – Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Parent Account Identification

The system SHALL identify a parent using:

* Phone number
* Email address

A parent account is automatically associated with students **only if**:

* The phone number or email matches data entered by the institution during student registration.

---

### 4.2 Institution & Student Visibility

The system SHALL allow a parent to:

* View a list of institutions where their details are registered
