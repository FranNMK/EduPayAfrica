# EduPay Africa

## Phase 1 MVP – System Description & Technical Requirements

---

### 1. Project Overview

EduPay Africa is a digital education finance platform designed to simplify and centralize school and university fee management across Africa, starting in Kenya.

Phase 1 focuses on delivering a **credible, functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** that introduces EduPay Africa, captures institutional interest, and lays a solid technical foundation for future fee payment and reconciliation features.

This phase prioritizes:

* Public visibility and trust
* Lead capture (demo requests)
* Secure authentication groundwork
* Scalable backend architecture

---

### 2. Phase 1 Objectives

The objectives of Phase 1 are to:

1. Provide a professional public-facing website for EduPay Africa
2. Clearly communicate the problem EduPay Africa solves and its long-term vision
3. Enable institutions to request product demonstrations online
4. Automatically acknowledge demo requests via email
5. Establish a secure authentication mechanism for future system access
6. Prepare the backend architecture for expansion into fee payment and reconciliation features

Phase 1 does **not** aim to fully implement fee payments or financial transactions.

---

### 3. Scope of Phase 1

#### 3.1 Public Website

The MVP will include a responsive website with the following pages:

* **Home**

  * Overview of EduPay Africa
  * Key challenges in education fee management
  * What EduPay Africa can currently do (Phase 1 capabilities)
  * Future platform vision

* **About Us**

  * Mission and purpose of EduPay Africa
  * Intended beneficiaries and institutions served

* **Contact Us**

  * Contact information
  * General inquiry form (non-authenticated)

* **News & Careers**

  * Platform updates
  * Career and partnership information (static or admin-managed)

#### 3.2 Navigation

The main navigation bar will include:

* Home
* About Us
* Contact Us
* News & Careers
* **Login** (authentication via Firebase)
* **Book a Demo** (institution lead capture)

---

### 4. Demo Booking Feature

Institutions interested in EduPay Africa will be able to request a demo through an online form.

#### 4.1 Data Collected

The demo request form will collect the following information:

* Full name
* Email address
* Phone number
* Institution name
* Institution type (University, College, School)
* Approximate number of students
* Optional message

#### 4.2 Backend Handling

* All demo requests are stored securely in the Django database
* Requests are viewable and manageable via the Django Admin interface
* Each successful submission triggers an automated confirmation email

#### 4.3 Automated Email Response

Upon submission, the requester will receive an automated email stating:

> “Welcome to EduPay Africa.
> Thank you for requesting a demo.
> Our team will get back to you shortly.”

This email serves as confirmation and establishes initial trust.

---

### 5. Authentication Strategy

Phase 1 integrates **Firebase Authentication** for identity management.

* **Firebase responsibilities**

  * User identity (email or phone-based login)
  * Secure authentication token issuance

* **Django responsibilities**

  * Firebase token verification
  * Local user mapping and persistence
  * Role and permission groundwork for future phases
  * Business logic and data access control

This separation ensures scalability and enables future mobile and web clients without redesigning authentication.

---

### 6. Django Application Architecture (Phase 1)

The Phase 1 backend is structured into **three core Django apps**, each with a clearly defined responsibility.

#### 6.1 `core` App – Public Website

**Purpose:**
Handles all public-facing pages and shared layout components.

**Responsibilities:**

* Home, About Us, Contact Us, News & Careers pages
* Base templates (navbar, footer, layout)
* Static content rendering
* General contact form (if applicable)

This app contains no business-critical data and focuses purely on presentation and content.

---

#### 6.2 `leads` App – Demo Requests

**Purpose:**
Manages institutional interest and demo bookings.

**Responsibilities:**

* DemoRequest data model
* Demo booking form and validation
* Secure storage of demo request data
* Automated confirmation email dispatch
* Admin interface for viewing and managing requests

This app represents the platform’s **initial business funnel** and is designed to evolve into onboarding or CRM functionality in later phases.

---

#### 6.3 `accounts` App – Authentication Bridge

**Purpose:**
Acts as the integration layer between Firebase Authentication and Django.

**Responsibilities:**

* Firebase ID token verification
* Creation and linking of Django users
* Preparation for role-based access control
* Authentication-related utilities and endpoints

Although limited in visible functionality in Phase 1, this app is critical for future secure access to payment and institutional features.

---

### 7. Technology Stack (Phase 1)

#### 7.1 Backend

* Django (Python web framework)
* Django REST Framework (API readiness)
* PostgreSQL (primary database)

#### 7.2 Authentication

* Firebase Authentication
* Firebase Admin SDK

#### 7.3 Frontend

* Django templates
* Bootstrap for responsive design

#### 7.4 Email

* SMTP-based email delivery (Gmail or transactional email service)

#### 7.5 Deployment

* Gunicorn (application server)
* WhiteNoise (static file serving)
* Cloud hosting platform (e.g. Render, Railway, Heroku)

---

### 8. Phase 1 Dependencies

Phase 1 requires the following Python dependencies:

* Django
* Django REST Framework
* Firebase Admin SDK
* Requests
* Python Dotenv
* Gunicorn
* WhiteNoise
* PostgreSQL database driver

These dependencies support core functionality, authentication, email handling, and deployment.

---

### 9. Security & Data Protection Considerations

* Sensitive credentials stored in environment variables
* Firebase authentication tokens verified server-side
* No financial or payment data handled in Phase 1
* Demo request data restricted to authorized administrators

---

### 10. Limitations of Phase 1

Phase 1 explicitly excludes:

* Fee payments and transactions
* M-Pesa or bank integrations
* Scholarship disbursement
* Multi-institution financial reconciliation
* Student or parent dashboards

These capabilities are intentionally deferred to later phases.

---

### 11. Success Criteria

Phase 1 will be considered successful if:

* The public website is accessible and responsive
* Demo requests are reliably captured and stored
* Automated confirmation emails are sent successfully
* Firebase authentication is functional and verifiable
* The system can be demonstrated live to stakeholders

---

### 12. Future Expansion (Phase 2 Preview)

Phase 2 will build upon this foundation to introduce:

* University and institution management
* Student profiles
* Fee structures and balances
* M-Pesa STK Push integration
* Payment reconciliation
* Parent and bursar dashboards
