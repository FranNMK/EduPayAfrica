AFTER GENERATING:
================

1. Copy the CSV output from ChatGPT
2. Paste into a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
3. Save as:
   - "students.csv" for student data
   - "staff.csv" for staff data
4. Use the file in your bulk upload feature in the admin panel

TIPS:
====
- Keep IDs consistent (institution=1, program=2, academic_year=2)
- Ensure emails are unique
- Use realistic Kenya phone numbers (254xxxxxxxxx)
- Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Use "True" or "False" for boolean fields (not true/false)
